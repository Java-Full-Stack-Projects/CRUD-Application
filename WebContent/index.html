<h2><center><u>Customer Management</u></center></h2>
<p>Customer Data is a precious asset to any business or Company.
A team that has clean, accurate data that is correctly formatted will be 
able to provide an appropriate level  of service while saving time and money.</p>

<p>Storing customer data on emails, spreadsheets or paper is a task in itself. 
It is very tedious to retrieve data from such sources, and there are high chances 
of this information to be misplaced or deleted because it is unorganized.</p>

<p> Thatâ€™s when a Customer Management System comes into the picture.
A customer management system is a cluster of all the systems, processes, 
and applications that are needed to manage customer relationships. 
It is also commonly known as Customer Relationship Management.</p>
